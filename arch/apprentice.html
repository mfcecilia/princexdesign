                <h3>The Process</h3>
                
                <p>Prior to starting work, it is recommended to know the <b>scope of work</b> which guides the design and the design team.</p>
                
                <p>Having a <b>budget</b> helps define the scope of work. Having a completion <b>date</b> helps to develop and guide the schedule for the project team.</p>
                
                <p>Every project starts with the Project Kick-Off meeting, where the project team discusses the program, documentation, and deliverables.</p>
                
                <p>All who complete the workshops are eligible to become an apprentice.</p>
