            <p>I always wanted to be apart of something where I felt I fit in, and I want to consider myself a big non conformist within society. I'm a male who loves women fashion and I want clothing to be marketed as Androgynous. I would love the opportunity to be trained, to see where I fit into this community, this company, and this family. So I will submit my resume and I've done your generic stuff for work to make money to have in my pocket. But I hope this team takes the time and consideration to see me. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Creative, Marketing</p>
            <p>My creative M.O. has always been “inspire confidence, cause a conversation, and ignite change.” Originally, my love of fashion came from the need to prove myself, be acknowledged, and ultimately be seen – this M.O. began as my own way of discovering and uncovering my place within the queer community. Then my personal motto became my professional goal. My work motivations lie in empowering others through creating imagery and video, campaigns and messaging, that allow people to feel represented, heard, and respected. I strive to create content that provokes discussion. By putting queer people at the forefront of my work, I aim to establish the queer market as something greater than a month-long marketing ploy, but rather, an honored target market that has a seat at the mainstream table. My work is deeply personal and I hope to continue working for queer fashion hubs throughout my career.</p>
